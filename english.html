         <h1>The Dog</h1>
             <p>
It's been about a month... I miss him. If I could take back all the good memories I spent with him, I would. Blue was a 1-2 year old dog; brown and white,
somewhat short but adorable pitbull. First few times I seen him I was scared but I really wanted to pet him. My brother was almost always with him, even before 
we got him, they both got along really well. His last owners didn't seem to care much about him,so they let us take him out for walks and he would be so excited.
His last owners seen that we really liked him, so they asked us if we wanted him. My brother and I knew for sure we wanted him, so we talked to my mom and she said 
we couldn't get him. In the end we convinced her and we ended up keeping him.As time passed (2-3 years) I had so much love for him. I enjoyed watching him grow. 
I think if anyone was having a bad day and they seen him, their day would get better. I know because that's what happened to me. He was everything to me. On August
of 2015 we moved houses and we couldn't take him with us. When I found out about that I was so sad. The saddest thing was seeing his little face, and how he just seemed sad, as if he knew what was going to happen. I remember the day my mom took him to the dog shelter. She came home and told me that she had left him at the dog shelter. My heart dropped when she told me that. I felt so empty. I never would have expected that a dog would make me feel so happy. One thing is for sure: I will never forget him no matter what.
